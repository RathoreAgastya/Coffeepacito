# Coffeepacito

Coffepacito is a single player game. The main objective is to collect as many beans (seems sus) as you can! Well, you die if you get hit by enemies (get rekt nob). You collect coffee beans with a coffee cup (so you can consume caffeine duh). The enemies are Coke, Tea and Fire. Your beans gets ruined when hit by coke, the tea cup is of superior material and breaks your cup, and fire just burns your cup.

## Controls 

Use arrow keys to move the cup around and collect beans by colliding with them. Try not to get hit the enemies üëø. If you get hit by an enemy, you lose and you have to close and close and open the game once again (yeah, that's how it is you lazy human)

## Backstory

Well, the name came from the song called desupacituo. So, once upon a time üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I was convinced by [Debarka](https://github.com/Coolstormaction) to make a game about coffee and fire, and BEEEANS, and coke, and tea. It was very weird at first but we enjoyed the making process of the game. I trolled him a lot. So, we ran into so many errors that I just got overheated and just said "I gotta go. I have study" and go play games. He tried to make sound effects for the game but it was so bad that I was wondering who is he. :)) See his version of trolling me at his github [repository](https://github.com/Coolstormaction/Coffeepacito)
